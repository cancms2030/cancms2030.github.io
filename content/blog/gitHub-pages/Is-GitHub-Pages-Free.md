*Understanding GitHub Pages' pricing model and limitations*

## The Short Answer: Yes, with Some Important Details

GitHub Pages is **completely free for most personal and open-source projects**. However, understanding the "free" label requires looking at what's included, what's limited, and when you might need to consider alternatives.

## What's Included in the Free Tier?

### 1. Unlimited Websites (with Limits)
- **Personal/Organization sites:** 1 site per GitHub account
- **Project sites:** Unlimited sites (one per repository)
- **Bandwidth:** 100GB per month
- **Storage:** 1GB per repository (standard GitHub limit)

### 2. Core Features at No Cost

## The Fine Print: Important Limitations

### 1. Repository Must Be Public
For free GitHub Pages hosting, your repository **must be public**. Anyone can see your source code. This is perfect for open-source projects but might not suit proprietary business sites.

### 2. Soft Usage Limits
While generous, limits exist:
- **Build time:** 10 minutes per build
- **Build frequency:** Limited concurrent builds
- **File size:** Individual files shouldn't exceed 100MB
- **Repository size:** 1GB soft limit (can be exceeded, but not recommended)

### 3. Content Restrictions
GitHub Pages cannot host:
- Commercial marketplaces
- Adult content
- Cryptocurrency mining services
- Violent or hate content
- Anything violating GitHub's Terms of Service

*Generous limits suitable for most projects*

## When You Might Need to Pay

### Scenario 1: Private Repository Hosting
If you need to host a website from a private repository, you'll need **GitHub Pro** ($4/month) or **GitHub Team** ($4/user/month).

### Scenario 2: High-Traffic Commercial Sites
While 100GB/month covers most sites, high-traffic commercial sites might need:
- **More bandwidth:** Consider Netlify, Vercel, or AWS
- **Dedicated support:** Enterprise hosting solutions
- **Custom SLAs:** Guaranteed uptime agreements

### Scenario 3: Advanced Features Needed
Free tier doesn't include:
- Password protection (without workarounds)
- Advanced access controls
- Enterprise-grade monitoring
- Priority support
